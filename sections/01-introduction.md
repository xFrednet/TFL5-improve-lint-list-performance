# Introduction

Rust is a programming language that focusses on performance, security an reliability. The first stable version Rust 1.0 was announced in in May 2015 [@rust-blog.rust1-0]. The project has since continued on a 6-week release cycle. Latest stable compiler version 1.51.0 being released on 25 of March 2021 [@rust-blog.rust1-51].

The Rust project develops several tools besides the compiler itself. These tools are seen as a vital part in automating parts of the development process and collaboration among teams. _Clippy_ the official linter of the Rust project is being developed in the _rust-clippy_ repository. The linter contains over 450 lints which span from complexity and style lints over to restriction lints which might be required by certificates [@github.clippy.readme]. Since 2018 Clippy is distributed as a component with the compiler itself [@github.rustup.1461].
