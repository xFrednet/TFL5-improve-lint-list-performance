# Requirements
The goal of this work is to improve the impression of Clippy's lint list. This section of the document will set a list of requirements to focus on in further research for this paper. These aspects are split up into:

* *Functional requirements*:
* *Non-functional requirements*:

This section is used to define a scope for further work. Listing all requirements which have already been implemented would draw focus from the key points. It is on the other hand important to keep them in mind. All requirements that have been implemented previously will therefor be summarized in the following functional requirement: _The functionality of the website should not be impacted by the implementation of new measures to improve the impression or usage._ This requirement covers functionality like the search feature, filter options and theming. The implementation of all of these has been completed at the point of writing this.

### Functional requirements
* List formal requirements
* Say: These formal requirements have also been defined as formal specifications:
* *Formal specifications*: Specifications that are unambiguous and formally defined. Formal specifications have the advantage that the precise description and limited scope reduce misunderstandings. These specifications are usually a translation of user requirements which are often expressed in natural language. This translation forces a detailed analysis of the requirements which often catches errors in them, that were previously hidden by ambiguous language. The fulfillment of these specifications can also be verified using manual or tool-supported methods [@book.Sommerville2010, p. 334].

### Informal specifications
* We need SPEED
    * Why are these informal? This paper want's to focus and work on the technical background not on fining the most optimal solution
