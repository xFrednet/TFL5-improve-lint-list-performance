# Analysis of benchmark results
This chapter will inspect each identified technical problem from section \ref{sec:measurement}. The inspection will first explain the technical background behind the problem and then identify the optimal configuration.

## HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
Ja ja toller text [@ietf.rfc6797]

## X-Frame-Options (XFO)
Some other explanation [@ietf.rfc7034]

## X-Content-Type-Options
What content to we want? All the content who do we trust: [@mozilla.developer.content-type-opt] and who was the weird inventor? Yes: [@microsoft.docs.ie8-security]

## Slow loading times

Some form of art
<!--
## Technical background

Give hosting background IE the website is deployed using GH Pages etc...

## Technical problems
* Explaining the grade C from _Mozilla Observatory_
* This should definitely include scientific sources to make this a valid paper
    * The examiner noted that the paper outline seems interesting but that I need to take care to include scientific sources
* Explanation why the listed security risks are security risks

## Slow loading times (Browser debug tools)
Mention works for:
* rustfmt's website shows that fast loading times are possible -> analysis

## Running benchmarks
